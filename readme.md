Why this plugin in 2013?
------------------------

Wordpress has a built-in comment pagination support since version 2.7. I can't use it for the following reasons, so I decided to keep paged comments

* When you reverse the order of comments, you need a [plugin][1] to fulfill the last page.
* Wordpress' default walker is memory intensive and some hosts (like aruba) with low memory limitations will experience issues on posts with lots of comments (~ 8'000 in my case).
* This plugin generates Bootstrap-compatible pagination markup.

Description

--------

* Comment ordering: show latest comments first, or last
* Specify number of comments to display per page
* Enable paging for all posts and pages, or on a per-post basis
* Give users the choice to view all comments on one page with a ’show all’ link
* Specify the first or last page of comments to load by default
* See [sample config file](http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/paged-comments/trunk/paged-comments-config-sample.php?format=txt) for more

Visit [the plugin page](http://www.keyvan.net/code/paged-comments/) for installation steps for the latest release of the plugin.

1. Download and extract plugin files to a folder locally.

2. Edit `paged-comments-config-sample.php` to configure, then save the file as `paged-comments-config.php`. 
   If you're upgrading and you already have a paged-comments-config.php file, you can ignore this step.
